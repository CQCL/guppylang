  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
8 |     measure(qs[0])
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Argument `qs` is borrowed, so it is implicitly returned to the caller. Value
with non-copyable type `qubit` was already used

Previous use occurred in linear_not_owned2.py:8 as an argument to `measure`.

Guppy compilation failed due to 1 previous error

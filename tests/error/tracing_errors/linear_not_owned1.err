   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Argument `q` is borrowed, so it is implicitly returned to the caller. Value with
non-copyable type `qubit` was already used

Previous use occurred in linear_not_owned1.py:11 as an argument to `measure`.

Guppy compilation failed due to 1 previous error

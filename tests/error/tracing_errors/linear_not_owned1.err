  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
7 |     measure(q)
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Argument `q` is borrowed, so it is implicitly returned to the caller. Value with
non-copyable type `qubit` was already used

Previous use occurred in linear_not_owned1.py:7 as an argument to `measure`.

Guppy compilation failed due to 1 previous error

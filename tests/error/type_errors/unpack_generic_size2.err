   |              ^^^^^^^^ Expression of type `SizedIter[Range, n]` cannot be unpacked

Note: Unpacking of iterable types like `SizedIter[Range, n]` is only allowed if
the number of items yielded by the iterator is statically known. Here, the
number of items `n` is generic and can change between different function
invocations.

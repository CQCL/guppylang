11 |     foo(nat(1 + 2))
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^ Value of this argument must be known at compile-time
   | 
11 |     foo(nat(1 + 2))
   |         ---------- This expression involves a dynamic computation, so its value
   |                    is not statically known

Note: We are currently investigating ways to make Guppy's compile-time reasoning
smarter. Please leave your feedback at

Error: Not known at compile-time (at $FILE:12:12)

   |                   ------ `m` is a function argument, so its value is not statically
   |                          known. Consider turning `m` into a comptime argument: `m:
   |                          @comptime`

Note: We are currently investigating ways to make Guppy's compile-time reasoning
smarter. Please leave your feedback at

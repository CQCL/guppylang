Error: Copy violation (at $FILE:8:10)
  | 
6 | def main(xs: array[int, 2] @ owned) -> array[int, 2]:
7 |    ys = xs
8 |    return xs
  |           ^^ Variable `xs` with non-copyable type `array[int, 2]` cannot
  |              be returned ...
  | 
7 |    ys = xs
  |         -- since it was already moved here

Help: Consider copying `xs` instead of moving it: `xs.copy()`

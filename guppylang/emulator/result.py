    r"""A result from running an emulator instance.


    Collects data from `result("tag", val)` calls in the guppy program. Includes results
    for all shots.

    Includes conversions to traditional distributions over bitstrings if a tagging
    convention is used, including conversion to a pytket BackendResult.

    Under this convention, tags are assumed to be a name of a bit register unless
    they fit the regex pattern `^([a-z][\w_]*)\[(\d+)\]$` (like `my_Reg[12]`) in which
    case they are assumed to refer to the nth element of a bit register.

    For results of the form ``` result("<register>", value) ``` `value` can be `{0, 1}`,
    wherein the register is assumed to be length 1, or lists over those values, wherein
    the list is taken to be the value of the entire register.

    For results of the form ``` result("<register>[n]", value) ``` `value` can only be
    `{0,1}`. The register is assumed to be at least `n+1` in size and unset elements are
    assumed to be `0`.

    Subsequent writes to the same register/element in the same shot will overwrite.

    To convert to a `BackendResult` all registers must be present in all shots, and
    register sizes cannot change between shots.

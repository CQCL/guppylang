name: Build and publish python wheels
# Builds and publishes the wheels on pypi.
#
# When running on a push-to-main event, or as a workflow dispatch on a branch,
# this workflow will do a dry-run publish to test-pypi.
#
# When running on a release event or as a workflow dispatch for a tag,
# and if the tag matches `hugr-py-v*`,
# this workflow will publish the wheels to pypi.
# If the version is already published, pypi just ignores it.
